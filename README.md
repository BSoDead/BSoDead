### Hey there 👋
📖 I'm a computer science student at ENSEEIHT, mostly interested in 3D rendering, computer graphics and physics simulations. Most of my projects are published as public, feel free to check out my pins 😁<br>
🚀 Currently working on the [7map](https://github.com/7map/7map) project, drop a star if you want to keep track of our work / contribute with some ideas.
